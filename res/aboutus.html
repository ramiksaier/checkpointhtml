    <h1> our organization</h1>
    
<p>
    Since 1999, we've invested more than $250 million in lifesaving animal welfare work across the country. <br>
      With more than 4,000 animal welfare partners, we inspire and empower communities to make a difference in the lives of animals. <br>
      Through our adoption efforts in more than 1,500 Petco stores nationwide, we've brought more than 6 million pets together with loving families. And we're just getting started.
